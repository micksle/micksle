### Greetings everybody, my name is Yaroslav, and I am currently busy on studying at the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute with a *computer science* degree. 
Alongside, i am studying Java and programming in general. My profile will represent some of the tasks that I perform, as well as additional courses and other
materials to improve my knowledge.

The main language, as I said before, is Java, but additional languages may appear here.
